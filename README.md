--Visual Novel--
This visual novel aims to entertain and educate about invasive species.
To run the visual novel, simply run the .exe file and the game will start.

The visual novel is a lighthearted experience, but still contains informational
content about the habitats of the invasive species, as well as the damage they
cause and the best method to combat them on a personal level.

The visual novel also contains a gallery containing a list of invasive species
found in Massachussetts. Some data is displayed, and a link can be clicked to
find more info. 

-- Webscraping Tool --
Included with the visual novel is a webscraping tool used to update the list of
invasive species found in Massachussetts. 

To run the webscraping tool, navigate to the directory containing both the game
and the webscraping tool invasive_scraper.py. Then, run the script with python
in that directory to update the game.

Ensure that all packages found in the invasive_scraper.py are installed in your
computer if any errors arise. 

NOTE: Do not move the game or script seperately. Move the outside dir instead.
