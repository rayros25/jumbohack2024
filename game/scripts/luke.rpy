    I wander through the forest in search for the last creature on my list.

    Finally, my journey was nearing its end. With the end of the "Spotted Lanternfly", I would receive the extra credit I was due!

    It wasn't too long before I spotted it in the distance. The lanternfly's bright coloration gave it away.
