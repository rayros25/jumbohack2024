Laboratory tests by the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station indicate that the ground cover Pachysandra terminalis) is also susceptible. Susceptibility of other plants in the Boxwood family (Buxaceae) is unknown. Buxus sempervirens may be more susceptible than other species. "], "appearance": ["Leaves develop brown spots with dark borders, often in a circular pattern, eventually expanding to cover the entire leaf.", "Foliage becomes blighted, turning light brown.", "Complete defoliation may occur.", "Shoots with multiple dark brown or black lesions (cankers) that are diamond-shaped or linear.", "Black streaks on stems.", "Under high humidity, white spore masses (sporodochia) may be visible on stem tissue and the undersides of leaves."], "damage": ["Boxwood blight is unsightly and can lead to near-complete defoliation. Root system remains intact but it is not recommended to retain damaged plant material because the disease can spread to healthy plants.", "Secondary infection by Volutella blight (Volutella buxi) or other pathogens may occur."], "picture": "bwb_thumbs_01.gif"}
