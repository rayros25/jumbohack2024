Hosts include fruits (apples, blueberry, peach, pear, strawberry, grapes, citrus), broadleaved weeds (plantain), vegetables (cabbage, corn, pepper, tomatoes), trees (oak, willow, poplar, walnut) and ornamentals (roses, chrysanthemums, dahlia). See the E. postvittana mini risk assessment for a full list of host plants: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/pest_detection/downloads/pra/epostvittanapra.pdf"], "appearance": [" The light brown apple moth has up to 4 generations per year in its native range, Australia.", "Females have a wingspan of about 2 cm. The forewings are a yellowish-brown color with markings that are less distinct than in the male moth. (Figure 1)", "Males are much smaller than females. The forewings of the male are yellowish-brown at the base of the wing with darker, red-brown markings towards the tip. Markings can be quite variable. (Figure 1) ", "Eggs are flattened and laid in groups on the upper surface of leaves. (Figure 2)", "Young larvae are tiny (a few mm long) with a yellow-green body and brown head. Larvae are 10-18 mm in length at maturity and green in color. (Figure 3)"], "damage": ["Caterpillars may damage the plant by feeding on the leaves, buds, shoots, and fruit. ", "Larvae construct silken shelters to feed under (Figure 4). Older larvae roll together leaves and buds. (Figure 5)", "Damage to the fruit has the greatest economic impact. Larval feeding on the fruit causes irregular brown areas on the fruit surface. Larvae sometimes enter the fruit to feed."], "picture": "LBAM_thumbs_01.gif"}
