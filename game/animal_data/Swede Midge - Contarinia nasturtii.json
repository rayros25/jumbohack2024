{"url": "https://massnrc.org/pests/pestFAQsheets/swedemidge.html", "name": "Swede Midge - Contarinia nasturtii", "description": "Look for the damage caused by the swede midge in crucifers (e.g. heads don't form, brown scarring along leaf stalks, distorted young shoots) because the larvae are difficult to detect.", "hosts": ["Known Hosts: Cruciferous vegetable crops including broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kale, collards, rutabagas, and radish. The highest levels of damage have been seen on broccoli, Chinese broccoli (gai lan), Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, Chinese cabbage, and other Asian greens. Cruciferous weed hosts include wild mustard, shepard\u2019s purse, stinkweed, field peppergrass, and yellow rocket."], "appearance": [" The adult is a small (1.5-2mm) light brown fly with hairy wings. ", "Adult population emerge from the beginning of May through the middle of October in Ontario, Canada with 3-5 peaks in population during the year.", "Full-grown larvae are 3-4 mm long and yellowish in color. ", "Eggs are very small (0.3mm) and laid on the youngest parts of the plant (e.g. flowers buds, leaf bases) often near the growing point of the plant. Eggs are transparent when first laid and change to a creamy white color as they mature. "], "damage": ["Swede Midge is difficult to distinguish from other midges.", "Plant damage caused by Swede midge looks similar to other problems with crucifers including molybdenum deficiency, mechanical injury from cultivation, hormonal herbicide injury, genetic variability of seed and heat or cold stress.", "Suspected plants need to be examined for the presence of larvae. Examine with a hand lens or force the larvae to leave the plant tissue by placing the affected plant part in a black plastic bag in the sun for several hours or placing damaged tissue in 70% alcohol."], "picture": "swedemidge_thumbs_01.gif"}
