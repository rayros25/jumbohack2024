Larval feeding stems in observed as scarring on the stems of host plants.", "hosts": ["Known Hosts: In Asia the Japanese cedar longhorned beetle is considered a secondary pest attacking stressed and freshly cut conifers. Known Asian hosts include Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica), Hinoki cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa), Sawara cypress (Chamaecyparis pisifera), false arborvitae (Thujopsis dolabrata), firs (Abies spp.) and pine (Pinus spp.)."], "appearance": ["Adults emerge from the host in early spring (Figure 2). They are 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6-14mm) in length with a slightly flattened body. Adult beetles are often found at the base of the crotch where two branches meet.", "Male have antennae that are slightly longer than their body. They are an irridescent blue-black color with reddish areas on the upper corners of the wing covers (elytra). Female have shorter antennae, reddish-brown elytra, and an orange-red abdomen. (Figure 3)", "Females lay small (1.4 mm), yellowish eggs in bark crevices in spring.", "Larvae feed within the stems forming shallow, serpentine galleries just beneath the bark. (Figure 4)", "The beetle pupates in the fall and overwinters as an adult inside the host. (Figure 5)"], "damage": ["Small oval exit holes (less than 0.25 inch) are created by adults exiting the wood in the spring. (Figure 6)", "Puckering incisions along the bark result from larval mining. Frass can be seen in openings to the tunnels. (Figures 7 and 8)"], "picture": "jclb_thumbs_01.gif"}
