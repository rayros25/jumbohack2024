When the population levels are high, adults may breed in logs of fir (Abies spp.), spruce (Picea spp.), and larch (Larix spp.).

Females lay eggs in niches on both sides of the egg gallery.", "Larvae hatch in late April to June and feed in galleries 1.5-3.5 inches (4-9cm) long radiating away from the egg laying gallery. ", "Larvae are legless, up to 5mm in length, and have a white body with a brown head.", "Mature larvae pupate and emerge as adults between July and October", "New adults will feed on the youngest shoots (new or 1 year old shoots) to reach maturation. Adults enter the shoot 6 inches (15cm) or less from the shoot tip and then bore for 1-4 inches (2.5\u201310cm) inside the shoot towards the tip. Each adult will feed on between 1 and 6 shoots.
